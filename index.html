          <p>My Favourtie Hobby is reading. After i come home from school i finish my Homework and get straight to Reading. It Increases my Knowledge. I am 10 years old and in 5th Standard, I now know that reading is a very good habit that anyone can Develop over their lifetime. Reading almost became my Favourite thing to do, but as I go to higher grades, my Reading Habit decreases, as I have school Homework and other writing work which takes up most of my Time, But I increase my Reading Time on Free Weekends, So Reading is a very good habit that Everyone should Develop!</p>
